More details located [here](https://github.com/mhukill/Crickets-Methods) with the help of Max Hukill and Professor Jack O'Brien. Max's Github page contains a video demonstrating how to use the pipeline along with supplementary materials. I have updates the R files on his Github and can be found in the [R files folder](https://github.com/esmall2023/DLC-guide-for-Bowdoin-College/tree/main/R%20files).
## Follow these steps to produce graphs of your DLC data

1. Once you have analyzed novel vidoes, DLC produces CSV files containing the xy-coordinates of each body part you tracked for each frame in the video. Once you have filtered these,
move them to a folder of your choosing.
2. Open R studio (make sure you have downloaded R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and open each of the 5 files locates in the [R files folder](https://github.com/esmall2023/DLC-guide-for-Bowdoin-College/tree/main/R%20files).
3. Set your working directory and output directory.
4. Now you have the graphs of each cricket located in your output directory. You will also have an excel file in your folder containing the average turn angles for each cricket at the first 70dB grouping of bursts (when they come from the left). 
5. Do whatever data anlysis you'd like with these results!
