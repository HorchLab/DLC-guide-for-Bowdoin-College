# Easy guide to use DeepLabCut on Bowdoin's HPC

This page belongs to the lab of Professor Hadley W. Horch at Bowdoin College. All of her behavioral data, along with DeepLabCut information and user guide are centralized in this GitHub location.

## `HPC_scripts/*`
Scripts that can be used on [Bowdoin's SLURM-based HPC Grid](https://www.bowdoin.edu/it/resources/high-performance-computing.html) for DeepLabCut tracking. 

## `DLC_output/*`
Hidden files (unpublished data), `.csv` (comma-separated file) outputted from DeepLabCut. 

## `R files/*`
Post-DLC processing. Visualizing and analyzing movements of the crickets. (This part is Cricket/*G. Bimaculatus* specific).
